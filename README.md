# SQL Projects ðŸ“‡
Some projects I did during my master's program, and some problem sets from the course cs50 - Introduction to computer science by Harvard University.

* Master's program project 

You have to create a database for the fire department: it includes all the fire stations and the firemen working there, which area they are in charge of and some information about all the trucks they own.
There is a file for creating the table, inserting data into the existing tables, performing multiple queries, and deleting the table.
