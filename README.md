# SQL Projects ðŸ“‡
Some projects I did during my master's program, and some problem sets from the course cs50 - Introduction to computer science by Harvard University.

* Master's program project 

You have to create a database for the fire department: it includes all the fire stations and the firemen working there, which area they are in charge of and some information about all the trucks they own.
There is a file for creating the table, inserting data into the existing tables, performing multiple queries, and deleting the table.

* cs50 Projects
I solved all three sets of problems from the cs50 computer science course from Harvard (https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/weeks/7/)
- Songs and Movies: explore databases and retrieve different information through queries
- Fiftyvill: conduct a police investigation to find a thief and his accomplice.
